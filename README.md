# Simple Math Functions

- `script.js`: analogue to native JS Math.pow() function. 
Works both with decimals and hexadecimals (expects both parameters to be of the same notation). 
`pw` should be a whole number (otherwise, it's converted to integer); `num` can be float. 
Params come from prompt, result is printed to the console.

- `newthon.js`: square root function. Uses Newthon's method. Uncomment in `index.html` to see it working.
