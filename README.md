# Custom pow() function

Analogue of native JS Math.pow() function.

Works both with decimals and hexadecimals (expects both parameters to be of the same notation).

`pw` should be a whole number (otherwise, it's converted to integer); `num` can be float.

Params come from prompt, result is printed to the console.
